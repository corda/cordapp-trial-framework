As you near the trial prospctive participants will be curious to understand how the GTM Trial program works and have many questions for you. The following questions are common and you should be prepared to address them.

## FAQs
* **Q**: How do we deploy the application? **A**: This is best answered with a reference back to historical documentation of a previous GTM Trial. Have an example document ready to send which details out the cloud infrastructure and scripted deployment.
* **Q**: Can we use Azure/AWS/GCP/etc instead of the cloud provider you recommend? **A**: Absolutely, the application uses standard open source tooling and is compatible across all the major cloud providers.
* **Q**: What operating system does the VM use? **A**: Ubuntu. Corda is compatible across most operating systems and most clients use a version of Linux. Likely you should only recommend OS based on what you have tested.
* **Q**: How much does a VM cost? **A**: As of writing prices on Azure are about $70-100 USD/month. This is easily covered by credits. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/ (D4s v3)
* **Q**: How many nodes do I have to run? **A**: At minimum one. Many participants decided they want to run multiple nodes to experience the application as other roles.
